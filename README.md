ML Classification Capstone project
## **EDA Conclusion**
* We found there are **95919** values are listed as **0**. Using some **google search** we found that **0**  meaning the **payment wasn't due**, which makes sense that most customers were using the revolving credit.
* Also we found **24415** values as **-2** which means **No consumption**.

* There are no **duplicate** IDs or rows.

* **30%** male have **default** payment while **26%** female have **defaul** payment, the difference is not significant.

* Also we can see **Female** have more **count** than **male**
